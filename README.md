# CV - Anneka Sillitoe

I am a front-end developer who loves working with React, Angular and other javascript frameworks. I'm also fond of using Node and love using SASS with my CSS and HTML.

Ultimately, my goal is to become awesome at writing simple, robust, scalable and readable code - through practice, learning and applying different programming skills, and by studying the approaches of other developers.
